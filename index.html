    <h1>BOOL LEAGUE POWER RANKINGS</h1>

    <h2>WEEK 9</h2>

    <h4>THE KING IS BACK EDITION</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Roc Silly Boys -- I doubted you, Stevie boy. But this team has continued to perform,
                showcasing displays of excellence week-in week-out. As the gap continues to increase
                between the top and bottom teams, the sloppy ranch-dressing queen has separated
                himself from the rest. But it’s close. Don’t get complacent.

                Total Football -- Teams in the Bool League have continuous nightmares about Coach
                Smith’s two-headed monster of Christian McCaffrey and Lamar Jackson. With both of
                their bye weeks finished, these two matchup-proof studs will carry any team to victory.
                Who needs a complete team?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The Brokeback Boolers -- Even though we doubt them consistently, the Brokeback
                Boolers come crawling back, and currently sit on top of the league standings with a 7-2
                record after nine weeks. After a night of steamy, non-consensual lovemaking with Dalvin
                Cook, Ryan decided he wasn’t going to take anymore disrespect on the power-rankings.
                He’s gunning for the title.

                Beane’s Boolin’ Beaners -- After rocking the league’s core in week 8 with a dominant
                performance, Coach Encina came out flaccid in week 9, disappointing everyone and
                casting doubt on that legendary performance just a couple weeks ago. Was it a fluke? Or
                will he run the table and get the ship back on track? The only thing more torn than
                Coach Encina’s decision-making at this point is T.Y. Hilton’s quad.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Moneyballers -- The rankings get a bit mucky after 4, with each team seemingly
                battling to miss playoffs. The best example of this is Coach Mochrie, who got a little too
                excited and blasted his team into the sun after Saquon Barkley stubbed his toe a few
                weeks back. If he wasn’t in the finals last year, I’d place him lower--but we all know Kyle
                has that winner’s mindset, and if anyone can right the ship it’s him.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Fournetteicatorz -- I spend more time trying to spell the name of your team than I do
                actually checking to see how you’ve been. All I know is that eventually, mediocre teams
                will regress to the mean and show their true colors. This team is a good example of that.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Barkley Reincarnated -- Like a phoenix from the ashes, Coach Glatz has managed two
                straight wins. I once called him a wildcard to win any week, and then I regretted that
                statement, because his team looked like horseshit. Now, though, I want to go back and
                un-regret it, because Alex is desperate to make playoffs, and I respect that hunger.
            </p>

            <p>
                James -- Even though his team loses most of the time, and definitely won’t win the
                division, and probably won’t make playoffs, and sometimes forgets to set his
                lineup--Coach Moore has assembled somewhat of a great roster. It’s hard to get
                anywhere without W’s, though, buddy. I consider this team a dark horse to sneak into
                playoffs.
            </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                Shitbag Titty Fuck -- You won a game, so I’m giving you a freebie bump in the rankings.
                I’m proud of you, bud. We’re all so proud of you.

                Drunk Taylor Swift -- Wow, did you give your boyfriend a pity-win or is your team really
                this dead in the water? If you’re Taylor Swift, this fantasy league is Kanye West,
                repeatedly embarrassing you and out-performing you. Be ashamed.
