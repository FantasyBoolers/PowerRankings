                Ram Ranchers-- Clearly, fate has decided for us that the Ram Ranchers are destined to be the first place
                team this year. It doesn’t matter what decisions Coach Clancy makes, or how good his opponent does. The
                points will come, every time. I’m not sure who he had to sacrifice to create this hellscape timeline,
                but this is Ryan’s world, and we’re all living in it.

                The Mockeries-- Coach Kyle is the antithesis of the Ram Ranchers--destiny has worked against him for
                three straight fantasy seasons now, plaguing his team with injuries every single year. Unlike Coach
                Clancy, we’ve seen Kyle work hard and make tough choices time and time again to keep his team
                competitive. For once, you aren’t leeching off the bottom playoff seed, desperately trying to survive. I
                foresee success in your future.

                Lube Cheeks-- This team has been the source of a controversy that nobody else in the league knows or
                cares about, but let’s move past the tabloid drama and take a look at this stacked, ranch-dressing
                powerhouse. Coach Gloss has more top-tier wide-receivers than the Turf Munchers have top tier players in
                their entire roster. Fun fact: in honor of our bottom two teams in the rankings, Steve got into a
                literal car wreck this week. Talk about commitment.

            <p>
                Ballin on a Budget-- It may seem like this team has sleepwalked its way into a playoff spot, even going
                so far as to literally auto-draft their team, but make no mistake--Coach Pritchard has certainly
                assembled a contender. With stars such as AJ Green, David Johnson, Mike Evans, and…. Josh Kelley…. And….
                I’m gonna stop here before I change my mind about this ranking.

                The Brainiacs-- 9th place in the standings, but 1st in everyone’s heart. After deciding to generously
                give the rest of the league a 5-game head start, the People’s Champ has returned in full force after
                assembling the greatest Fantasy Football roster we’ve ever seen. To the other teams fighting desperately
                for that last playoff spot--prepare to get dick-punched.

                Hotchubb Time Machine-- A true illusionist, Coach Volta has disappeared and re-appeared in the playoff
                race three or four times already this season. Was last week a sham? Was it real? Are his starting
                running backs really Boston Scott and La’Mical Perine, or is this some kind of sick joke? Seriously,
                that wasn’t rhetorical.

        <li>
            <p>
                OG Lube Cheeks-- This is getting out of hand, now there’s two of them. Coach Drexel was so sure that he
                was going to come out of this week with a win, that the league has actively put him on suicide watch in
                the aftermath of a devastating loss. ESPN is reporting that he rejected a one-for-one trade offer of
                Josh Jacobs for JaMycal Hasty this morning, and when we reached out to him for an interview, all we
                could make out was slurred, incoherent ramblings about how Coach Gloss stole his team name, and how he
                can’t wait to make playoffs. Nobody tell him, guys.
                <strong><br><br>Playoff Chances: 32%</strong>

            <p>
                Nobody.-- After looking at the three remaining teams, I came to the conclusion that nobody deserves 8th
                place. It’s too high for any of these teams, quite frankly. Moving on.
                <strong><br><br> </strong>

            <p>
                The McDermonators-- If anybody ever looks you in the eye and tells you that there’s no such thing as
                luck in Fantasy Football, point that person in the direction of the 2020 McDermonators. I’ve never seen
                a team with more blatant plot armor than this, and quite frankly, it's starting to make me sick. The sad
                truth is, Coach Encina is going to trip and fall into the playoffs and get absolutely annihilated by the
                first team that looks in his general direction. We all can’t wait.

        <li>
            <p>
                The Alex’s Redskins-- After trading his best player for a sandpaper handjob that Coach Smith bought him
                on Fiver in the parking lot of a 7/11, Alex laughed victoriously, certain that playoffs were in his
                future. The rest of the league looked on in disgust, repulsed that Coach Glatz had somehow reached a new
                low, even for him.
                <strong><br><br>Playoff Chances: 42%</strong>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Turf Munchers-- Do we really have to keep talking about this team? You all read the entry for #10, and
                how bad that was. Let it sink in that Coach Mungilo has crafted a team that is FAR worse than the next
                lowest on the power rankings. Just disgusting. It’s time to start looking at next year’s draft, my
                friend.
