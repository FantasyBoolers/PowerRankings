    <h2>WEEK 10</h2>

    <h4>Apocalypse Edition</h4>
    <p>Drunk Taylor Swift vs. The Fournetteicatorz!</p>

            <p>
                Total Football- Coach Smith finds himself atop the power rankings once again! This guy is sitting in
                the VIP section, popping bottles of bubbly with all the hottest dudes! If you want in you gotta get
                through
                the two colossal bodyguards who are staring at you like the piece of meat that you are: Christian "100%
                Snaps" McCaffrey and Lamar "RB1" Jackson. Shane is living proof that you only need two players to win
                fantasy football games, as long as they're the <i>best</i> players. Furthermore, Ronald Jones was seen
                exiting Sundays game on an Ashen horse, foretelling the end of the league as we know it. Three modest
                heroes stand between us and this truly horrifying Fantasy Apocalypse: Coach Mochrie, Ms. Coach Clancy,
                and Coach Mungillo. Can our heroes stop this tyrant from claiming a first round bye… please?

                Roc Silly Boys- If Shane's team has the Horseman of the Apocalypse then Chris GODwin is literally God
                and Michael Thomas is Black Jesus. Coach Gloss has expertly deployed his holy duo of star wide
                receivers, bringing him to a 7-3 record and a shot at a first round bye. This is all while having the
                second most points against! This week, the most slippery QB in the league, Russell Wilson, has slipped
                right into a bye, leaving Gloss hanging for his matchup with Coach Glatz. In other news, Kyle Rudolph
                has spontaneously combusted into the world of fantasy relevance. Gloss wasted no time snagging the
                Minnesota TE and has since been celebrating what it's like to root for a team with a fantasy relevant
                TE. There's also a rumor Gloss has pretty soft hands.

                Brokeback Boolers- Another matchup, another week on top of division two. Except this time Coach Drexel
                is hot on his tail! Despite putting up a very respectable 124 points in week 10, Coach Clancy suffered a
                rough loss to Coach James. This brought his stellar record back down to Earth and sent him running home
                to Dalvin Cook, with whom he initiated intercourse. It was, of course, nonconsensual. He cried during.
                Lucky for Ryan, he can't stay down while there's crazy tinder thots to hit on and CoD bodies to stack,
                which is literally always so he'll be just fine. This week Coach Clancy aims to reaffirm his position on
                top of division two and secure his first round bye. But to do this he'll have to get through the lean,
                mean, Beanes, and they don't aim to lose to the Clancy's two weeks in a row.

                The Fournetteicatorz- Coach Drexel eazed out a win againzt the now 4-6 Moneyballerz last week,
                propelling him into the running for a firzt round bye in divizion 2! By the graze of GODwin, Jazon haz
                managed to all but zecure a playoff zpot while zimultaneouzly acruing the leazt pointz in the divizion.
                In hiz defenze, Coach Drexel kicked off with a rough ztart to the zeason but has zince put together a
                team truly worth rozterbating ztanding up over. All of this culminatez in a path to the playoffz more
                crooked than Jazon'z dick. This week he is set to take on Erin Clancy in "Drexel Strikes Back!"

                Beane's Boolers- With one hand white knuckled on a fantasy playoff spot and the other planted firmly on
                Steve Gloss's hand, Coach Encina can but helplessly stand by as his season transitions from "competing
                for a bye," to "a playoff spot is fine," to "oh God I need to win this week." This team has no shortage
                of underforming RB1s but it does have a shortage of calves, knees, ankles, and a will to carry on.
                Emilio was seen desperately stapling "Lost Quads, Reward Offered" flyers to all the telephone polls in a
                5 mile radius. Even though this team has had it's issues with consistency, it's still star studded and
                capable of putting up monster weeks, and that's exactly what I intend to do against Ryan this week.

                The Moneyballers- VIBE CHECK! Coach Mochrie headlines our bottom half this week, which also makes him
                the most qualified to put an end to Coach Smith's rein! Coach Mochrie has a rich history of fantasy
                upsets that include, but are not limited to: a deep 2018 playoff run out of the 6th seed, and a week 4
                upset win over Coach Encina in the Beeg Beeg Hockey League, you motherfucker. Coincidentally, he will
                face Shane THIS WEEK, which is shaping up to be Kyle's most important matchup of the year! Not only is
                our hero fighting for the leagues freedom from a malevolent band of miscreants, but Coach Mochrie aims
                to secure his own playoff spot in a league where every win counts. Coach Smith looks to Kareem HUNT down
                Kyle and secure a first round bye, but Kyle and his fat CHUBB think otherwise. Who will win the battle
                of Cleveland's backfield? Who will prevail in the battle for the league? More importantly: What. Are.

                Team james195- James comes in at number 7 as the next team fighting for a coveted playoff spot. Two
                weeks ago I warned members that James’ team is to be feared but he can’t quite seem to string together
                multiple wins. I will say that he has been consistently putting up 100+ points which puts him firmly in
                contention for the spot. But he can’t earn it without WINS and that’s exactly what he did last week. The
                silent warrior of the McGregors league boasted 125 points to take down our resident web designer Coach
                Mochrie. This week Coach James will try his luck against Coach Mungillo. He will almost undoubtedly win
                and bring his streak to W2, which is enough to propel him over Coach Mochrie both in the standings and
                power rankings if Kyle is to lose to Shane. Godspeed James.

                Drunk Taylor Swift - Yo, Erin, I'm really happy for you, I'ma let you finish, but Beane's Boolers had
                one of the best <s>videos</s> fantasy lineups of all time! Seriously though congratulations on the win.
                I came into week 10 expecting to explode your team and, firmly, did not. The Clancy without a penis saw
                an immense surge in scoring as her star wide receiver Devante Adams had a return to form in week 10. In
                fact, her triple homer stack scored her a total of 53 points! Not too shabby considering Aaron Rodgers
                was dragging his feet. Some might say that drafting an RB, WR, and QB all from the same team is a bad
                idea but this time it earned Erin a win. Hence this Cheese Head has maintained herself in the race for a
                playoff spot (notice a pattern here?). With the utmost of importance at hand, Coach Erin Clancy with
                face off against Coach Jason Drexel out Sunday Night Rivalry headliner this week!

                Barkley reincarnated- Coach Glatz felt a truly crushing defeat delivered by Coach Smith in week 10.
                Another victim. Lucky for Alex all this did was bring his record in line with the rest of the teams
                fighting for a playoff spot. We are now sporting a 4 way tie for 6th making these coming weeks all the
                more important for Alex. Judging by his prevailing team name, one thing remains true about Alex's
                season: he is being haunted by the ghost of Saquon past. He can find solidarity in the fact that so am
                I. If Alex wants to make playoffs he will need to light a fire under his squad, unfortunately it's windy
                and he's using a blowtorch. In week 10 Coach Glatz has an uphill battle against Steve Gloss. Good thing
                for Glatz, Coach Gloss will be without the aforementioned Russel Wilson, giving Alex a chance to draw
                blood. I'm personally rooting for this teams success.
