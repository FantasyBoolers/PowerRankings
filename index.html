        <p>
            Welcome ladies and gentlemen to our Bool League end of season award ceremony! It was kind of a crazy regular
            season, just wanted to say thank you to everyone for playing again this year and kudos to everyone powering
            through all these insane covid and IR stints. To the 4 teams that missed: best of luck not coming in last in
            the consolation bracket; and to everyone that was fortunate enough to make playoffs: game on losers
            <br><br>
            Kinda went crazy with these

            Congratulations to Coach Clancy on finishing on top of the leaderboards this year, Ryan put up a hearty 11-2
            record and a very impressive 6-1 divisional record. Although Coach Clancy didn't face much adversity this
            year, his record is no fluke: Clancy put up 1702.34 points-for, good for second highest in the league.

            R2 was the perfect antithesis to Coach Clancy’s 11-2 record, seeing as he posted 2 wins and 11 losses. With
            a heavy heart I award this title to our favorite Cowboys fan, and much like his actual team, it has not been
            a good year. In fact, this is the second consecutive year that Coach Mungillo has bottomed out the Bool
            League and there are rumblings that he is trying for the three-peat. Come back next year and prove us wrong!

            </h3>
            With a total of 588.9 points across his top 3 WR’s, Coach Gloss takes the title for the best receiver room
            in the league! Not only did Gloss have the highest total points this year but he also had the highest
            individual scoring WR, Tyreek Hill, who scored 237.9 points to himself. If that's not enough, Steve had 3
            wide receivers in the top 8; the two not already mentioned being Justin Jefferson and Deandre Hopkins. Good
            Job Steve we all knew you were a catcher not a pitcher anyway

            <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0px;">Best RB Core - The Mockeries
            </h3>
            Coach Mochrie totalled 401.5 fantasy points between his top 2 RB’s Dalvin Cook and Ronald Jones! Dalvin Cook
            took the cake for best regular season RB with a WHOPPING 257.9 points, are we noticing a theme here? His RB
            2, Ronald Jones surprised many, or at least me, by finishing as the number 10 RB of the regular season,
            creating a 1-2 punch in the backfield that Kyle was able to consistently rely upon, except for that one time
            D. Cook was out.

        <p>Just wanted to note that while WR’s were kinda stacked to one or two teams, a lot of teams were veeerry close
            at RB.

            Kyle finished the season with 1708.96 regular season points giving him the win and the title of scariest

            Somewhat miraculously Ryan ended up with the best draft class of the year scoring a huge 1420.92 points from
            players he drafted. Thanks daddy Allen

            </h3>
            This pick was just ridiculous. Gloss homed his Vikes by grabbing up Justin Jefferson at pick 137 in the 14th
            round, who then went on to finish as the 4th overall half ppr wide receiver. What an absolute steal JJ was
            in fantasy and for the Vikings IRL, he's just so sick. Justin Jefferson is a sick player with sick hands.
            Brutal hands are sick too.

            with opponents averaging 109.5 points. Like I said, not much adversity here and that's just the way he likes
            it.

        <h3>Lube Cheeks Vs. OG Lube Cheeks
        </h3>
        <p>
            There comes a moment when friend must turn on friend, brother must turn on brother, lubed cheek on lubed
            cheek. That moment is now, and I think I speak for everyone when I say: it’s the moment we've all been
            waiting for.</p>
        <p>How poetic for these star crossed lovers to be matched together in the first round of playoffs. Coach Drexel
            and Coach Gloss have carved out a similar path to playoffs with each of them brandishing a 7-6 win-loss
            ratio and a cool 1600 points-for. Maybe as a surprise to some, Coach Drexel eked out the seeding advantage
            by coming from the bottom, as he usually does, to overtaker Gloss in the standings (I called this in week
            8).</p>
        <p>As of right now, Jason is projected to edge out Gloss by a close difference of 4 points but both teams look
            little banged up and a single out designation could sway either team from hope to crushing defeat. If I had
            to pick right now, I’d give slight edge to Juice just because of the devastating Rodgers Adams Stack. Too
            bad because Josh Jacobs would really seal things here. That being said both teams have some great matchups
            and are primed for big points. This is a matchup to scout and whoever wins is gonna give Coach Clancy a run
            for his money in Semi’s. We all have heard about the side action *Gone Sexual* but will we finally get a
            conclusion to the league's most controversial figures, or will this matchup only bring out more accusations?
            Probably that one. Good Luck Boys!

        <h3>McDermonators Vs. Ballin On a Budget
        </h3>
        <p>Coach Pritchard has made his triumphant return to the Bool League after a 1 year hiatus in 2019. Some may
            remember his 2018 roster that terrorized other Boolers and brought Casey to first overall in the regular
            season
            and a first round playoff bye. With his appearance this year Ballin on a Budget is not 2 for 2 on making
            playoffs, but this year he snuck in as the 6th seed. For that he gets to face the 3rd place team: The
            McDermonators.</p>
        <p>Coach Encina has been the second luckiest team in the league, angering some, bewildering many with multiple
            single digit victories that he was absolutely not deserving of but took with astounding grace and poise. The
            McDermonators suffered many weeks at the hand of first overall pick Christian McCaffrey but the time has
            hopefully come for the prodigal Running Back to return to the lineup, Quads permitting. Just in time too
            seeing
            as Touchdownio Gibszn just went down with turf toe.</p>
        <p>IF we see a return from CMC then this should be a very tight race between Encina and Pritchard. Both teams
            have
            excellent stacks at Qb-Wr in Herb-Allen and Russ-Dk, and both stacks are seeing premium matchups against
            Atlanta
            and the Jets respectively. Casey’s team is rounded out by Amari Cooper, a healthy David Johnson and Clyde
            Edwards-NOWHERE while Emilio has been beside himself. Driving around downtown Charlotte begging (thru texts)
            Matt Rhule to play Christian McCaffrey. Will Casey find fantasy football redemption in 2020? Will Emilio
            continue his streak of winning every Bool League playoff game he has ever appeared in?</p>
        <p>If CMC plays then I have to give the slightest edge to myself on this one, otherwise Casey you got this easy.
            This matchup holds all the power in Semi Final seeding, If The McDermonators take it then we will see Coach
            Encina move on to face The Mockeries and the winner of the Cheek Bowl gets Ram Ranchers. If Ballin on a
            Budget
            takes it then Casey will be seeing Coach Clancy’s Ram Ranchers and the greatest Cheeks gets to play Kyle.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <p>Make your picks everyone! Thanks for playing the regular season! Neither matchup in week 14 features a player
            from TNF of Rams vs Pats so we can all have an unbiased time watching some good clean Cyberpunk 2077. FTP

                Ram Ranchers-- Clearly, fate has decided for us that the Ram Ranchers are destined to be the first place
                team this year. It doesn’t matter what decisions Coach Clancy makes, or how good his opponent does. The

                but this is Ryan’s world, and we’re all living in it.

                The Mockeries-- Coach Kyle is the antithesis of the Ram Ranchers--destiny has worked against him for
                three straight fantasy seasons now, plaguing his team with injuries every single year. Unlike Coach
                Clancy, we’ve seen Kyle work hard and make tough choices time and time again to keep his team
                competitive. For once, you aren’t leeching off the bottom playoff seed, desperately trying to survive. I
                foresee success in your future.

                Lube Cheeks-- This team has been the source of a controversy that nobody else in the league knows or
                cares about, but let’s move past the tabloid drama and take a look at this stacked, ranch-dressing
                powerhouse. Coach Gloss has more top-tier wide-receivers than the Turf Munchers have top tier players in
                their entire roster. Fun fact: in honor of our bottom two teams in the rankings, Steve got into a
                literal car wreck this week. Talk about commitment.

                Ballin on a Budget-- It may seem like this team has sleepwalked its way into a playoff spot, even going
                so far as to literally auto-draft their team, but make no mistake--Coach Pritchard has certainly
                assembled a contender. With stars such as AJ Green, David Johnson, Mike Evans, and…. Josh Kelley…. And….
                I’m gonna stop here before I change my mind about this ranking.

                The Brainiacs-- 9th place in the standings, but 1st in everyone’s heart. After deciding to generously
                give the rest of the league a 5-game head start, the People’s Champ has returned in full force after
                assembling the greatest Fantasy Football roster we’ve ever seen. To the other teams fighting desperately
                for that last playoff spot--prepare to get dick-punched.

                Hotchubb Time Machine-- A true illusionist, Coach Volta has disappeared and re-appeared in the playoff
                race three or four times already this season. Was last week a sham? Was it real? Are his starting
                running backs really Boston Scott and La’Mical Perine, or is this some kind of sick joke? Seriously,
                that wasn’t rhetorical.

                OG Lube Cheeks-- This is getting out of hand, now there’s two of them. Coach Drexel was so sure that he
                was going to come out of this week with a win, that the league has actively put him on suicide watch in
                the aftermath of a devastating loss. ESPN is reporting that he rejected a one-for-one trade offer of
                Josh Jacobs for JaMycal Hasty this morning, and when we reached out to him for an interview, all we
                could make out was slurred, incoherent ramblings about how Coach Gloss stole his team name, and how he
                can’t wait to make playoffs. Nobody tell him, guys.

                Nobody.-- After looking at the three remaining teams, I came to the conclusion that nobody deserves 8th
                place. It’s too high for any of these teams, quite frankly. Moving on.

                The McDermonators-- If anybody ever looks you in the eye and tells you that there’s no such thing as
                luck in Fantasy Football, point that person in the direction of the 2020 McDermonators. I’ve never seen
                a team with more blatant plot armor than this, and quite frankly, it's starting to make me sick. The sad
                truth is, Coach Encina is going to trip and fall into the playoffs and get absolutely annihilated by the
                first team that looks in his general direction. We all can’t wait.

                The Alex’s Redskins-- After trading his best player for a sandpaper handjob that Coach Smith bought him
                on Fiver in the parking lot of a 7/11, Alex laughed victoriously, certain that playoffs were in his
                future. The rest of the league looked on in disgust, repulsed that Coach Glatz had somehow reached a new
                low, even for him.

                Turf Munchers-- Do we really have to keep talking about this team? You all read the entry for #10, and
                how bad that was. Let it sink in that Coach Mungilo has crafted a team that is FAR worse than the next
                lowest on the power rankings. Just disgusting. It’s time to start looking at next year’s draft, my
                friend.
