                    Yobby Gang-- Was there any doubt, folks? It’s an odd-numbered year, and the people’s champ is back
                    to claim his second title, and this dynamite-level draft is just the perfect way to kick that off.
                    The best runningback, the best quarterback, the best tight-end, the best fantasy manager… How is
                    this even fair? Ignore my last place finish last year, by the way. That was a joke.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    YEET-- Newcomer to the Bool League, Andrew, has come out of the draft with a fierce roster with
                    fantastic depth. There’s a bit of weakness at tight end, but if he can figure out that issue then we
                    might just have a real contender on our hands. The only other downside is that he’s an Eagles fan…
                    yuck.

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Jefferson? I hardly know em-- Coach Gloss, a seasoned veteran of the Bool League and perennial
                    playoff contender, has put together a pretty stacked lineup once again. Like the previous entry,
                    there’s a bit of a gap at the tight end position but it’s hardly a concern right now. What should be
                    a concern right now for Coach Gloss is the allegations…

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    OG Lube Cheeks-- Coach Drexel and Coach Gloss, back to back in the rankings. Some things never
                    change, much like their ongoing, passionate love affair. It’s Bool League time, though, and that
                    love affair will quickly turn into a steamy, heated rivalry. This is a good team, though, really.
                    But I’ve knocked you down a spot for drafting two defenses back to back.

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Ballin on a Budget-- Casey threw together a pretty nice team here in the draft, establishing an
                    excellent RB core and a pretty solid set of receivers. On top of that, he’s got a great QB and a
                    sleeper at TE… This team could be a dark horse going into the season, which is appropriate, since
                    Casey is the league’s only black manager.

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The Mockeries-- Coach Kyle has once again thrown together a team that looks like it can compete
                    straight out of the gate. If he can avoid injuries and keep sending me feet pics under the table, he
                    might find himself in a pretty favorable position at some point this season, especially if Jalen
                    Hurts pans out.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Stephen’s Legit Team-- Another Bool League newcomer, Stephen appears to have drafted a team that
                    screams boom or bust. The absolute volatility from this roster both scares and excites me. This is
                    likely going to be one of the only weeks that this team will be in the middle of the power rankings.
                    Expect either a massive bump or a massive drop after week 1.

                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Ram Ranchers-- As the reigning champ of the Bool League, Coach Clancy had a lot of expectations on
                    his shoulders to come out of the draft with a fantastic team. Instead of doing that, he drafted
                    three tight ends and three quarterbacks, all but guaranteeing an absolute lack of depth. Despite his
                    awful decisions, he’s got a scary starting lineup that could either win him weeks or split at the
                    seams at the first sign of injury.

                <p>
                    Alexs Football Team-- A seasoned veteran of the Bool League, Alex came out of the draft with a team
                    that I really want to like, but can’t quite fully get behind. Despite the acquisition of Travis
                    Kelce, the whole thing is just… meh. Solid floor team, though--don’t expect Alex to ever be an easy
                    win assuming his team stays intact. Will need some more firepower to be a playoff contender, though.

                <p>
                    Diggs in a Blanket-- Newcomer Savanah has thrown together a pretty decent team despite a few
                    baffling picks, like Devin Singletary in the 7th round. What the fuck were you thinking? I know it
                    was a homer pick, but WOW. Sorry, but that one is just unforgivable. Welcome to the Bool League,
                    Savanah.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Barbz of America-- Pretty bad team with non-existent depth, but there’s always Patrick Mahomes which
                    is promising. And, for what it’s worth, some of your starters do have some pretty crazy upside that
                    I’m curious about. But don’t expect this team anywhere near the playoffs barring some major
                    overhauls. Welcome back to the Bool League, Erin!

                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    The McDermonators-- What can I say? Literally nothing about this team excites me. Even the biggest
                    and proudest members of the Tua gang can’t get behind this. At least he’s got actual rapist Ben
                    Roethlisberger just in case things go super ugly, but still… Decent depth, decent starters
                    otherwise, but just ugly. Really ugly. I doubt this team finishes last because Coach Encina wheels
                    and deals, but I hate everything about this team except for his tight end and RB1.
