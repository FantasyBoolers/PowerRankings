                Total Football--Where is your God now? I have come into your home, upturned your
                dining room chairs, spilled your coffee grounds all over your kitchen floor, kicked your
                dog, and defiled your backyard patio set. Who can stop me from reaching my destiny?

                Roc Silly Boys-- Glossy-boy got back to form this week, letting the world forget he lost to
                Alex a few weeks ago with a dominating win over the Brokeback Boolers. Unlike Emilio, I
                have only a limited amount of inside jokes at my disposal, so Iâ€™m gonna go back to the
                Ranch analogy. Since Glossâ€™ dominating form came to a start, blue-cheese apologists
                have fled for the streets, desperate to escape the incoming wave and prevent it from
                washing over them the way it washed over Gloss a year and a half ago. What an origin
                story.

                The Fournetticatorz--Somehow, the Bool League has a new foe to fear. He longs for the
                feel of Leonard Fournetteâ€™s sweaty hands around his waist, lifting him up along with the
                Fantasy Trophy at the end of the year. Is this real life, or is it just fantasy? Potentially,
                both.

                The Brokeback Boolers--Rounding out the elite four is Coach Clancy, who took a
                humiliating defeat this week. No amount of Hollywood Brown could have stopped Ryan
                from looking like a Hollywood ðŸ¤¡. He claims it was all because of bye-weeks, but I see the facade
                cracking with each passing week. Is a first-round exit in store for this coach?

                The Moneyballers--Shrewd pickups and nifty last-minute starts have saved Coach
                Mochrieâ€™s playoff chances yet. But, somehow, I get the impression thereâ€™s someone
                working behind the scenes, instructing him what to do and who to start. Some sort ofâ€¦
                Fantasy Football genius, perhaps. But who could it be?

                Team james195--James picked up a big olâ€™ win this week to keep his own playoff
                chances alive, but he enters must-win territory in the last week of the regular season. As
                heâ€™s already crashed and burned out of playoff contention in the Gates Rec league
                (much like yours truly), perhaps he will now focus his full attention on this league. I made
                him my sleeper pick for playoffs, and Iâ€™m standing by that prediction.

                Barkley Reincarnated--Okay, okay, I admit it. Iâ€™m the one who told Kyle to start Jonathan
                Williams on Thursday Night Football. Iâ€™m the man behind the curtain. Iâ€™m sorry, Alex. I
                donâ€™t know why I did it. I just wanted it to be a little exciting, I didnâ€™t think he was going to
                just pulverise you. In a way, really, itâ€™s your own fault. Maybe youâ€™ll still make it?

                Beaneâ€™s Boolers--This is a bigger self-destruction than the Hindenburg. Coach Encinaâ€™s
                team has gone from Boom or Bust to just bust, with all booms reserved for his own team
                â€˜boomingâ€™ out of the playoffs, making him the leagueâ€™s honorary boomer. Ok boomer.

                Shitbag Titty Fuck--Iâ€™m proud of you. You tried your bestest, and thatâ€™s what really
                matters at the end of the day. :)

                Drunk Taylor Swift--Iâ€™m not entirely sure if you tried at all, so I am definitely not proud of
                you. At least the Packers are good? Oh, wait, they just got pounded by the Niners on
                primetime football, mirroring whatâ€™s going to happen in week 13 when you face off
                against TOTAL FOOTBALL.
