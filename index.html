                Total Football - Coach Smith Come on down! You are our GRAND PRIZE winner this week! You get an all
                expenses paid trip to play the team coming off of 185 points! -- This team has been the embodiment of
                consistency, scoring over 120 points in 6/8 weeks, never dipping below 100, and having one of the
                hardest schedules to boot. Despite Beane’s Boolers having an explosive week 8 and now topping the charts
                for points, this team is not quite ready to give up the number one spot. This week’s next matchup will
                decide! -- Tune in week 9 to find out who bools the hardest!
            </p>

                Beane’s Boolers - Oatmealio the Dealio has done it boys! First and foremost I wanna thank Steve Gloss,
                for being my heart and my soul, couldn’t have done it without you babe. This years winner of 5 best
                manager awards has now scored 185 points, a league record, and earned his much deserved spot on top of
                the points-for chart. Beane’s Boolers, colloquially known by most as Beaners, are looking like a force
                to be reckoned with. Will these Beaners bool out of control in week 9, or get lost in the sauce? Catch
                you nerds in week 15.

                Roc Silly Boys - Gloss was looking like a league favorite a couple weeks ago but completely dudded out
                in week 7 against probably the last team he wanted to dud out against, The Fournetteicatorz. Week 8 has
                been a gracious return to form as Coach gloss was seen in a physical altercation with an intoxicated
                Taylor Swift, who was later reported to be Erin Clancy, after becoming excessively intoxicated himself
                when the yankees were suplexed into an American League finals exit. Hopefully Ill see this team in the
                finals week 16 where we can finally hold hands in peace.

                Brokeback Boolers - Rolling in at number 4 we have the brokeback boolers! This team had an explosive
                start to the season but has since teetered off with some middling finishes, much like his tinder
                history. The turn in Coach Clancy’s luck can be traced back to a week 5 trade in which he moved Nick
                Chubb for Travis Kelce and ever since losing Chubb, Ryans roster chubb has also disappeared. I know Josh
                Allen superfan Coach Clancy currently has the best record in the league, but just like the Buffalo
                Bills, something feels off, and that thing is his shirt.

                The Moneyballers - Rounding out the top half this week is Coach Mochrie. This team is the only 4-4 team
                in the league but don’t underestimate him. The Moneyballers have been plagued by injuries and sorely
                missed Saquon Barkley the few last week. In response to receiving touchdown notifications for a Saquon
                Kyle no longer had, he entered week 8 speeding a 140 point party bus with “FUCK QUADS” written on the
                side. Unfortunately he drove it directly into the brick wall that was the Beaners this week. I mean this
                guy got killed faster than Jeffrey Epstein. We’ll see if Coach Mochrie can put up another monster week
                and potentially dethrone the Brokeback Boolers from their debaucherous throne in week 9.

                The Fournetteicatorz- Wow what a story this team has been. This season Coach Drexel has faced ups and
                downs, adversity, and prosecution, much like his real life as a gay man in the United States Marine
                Corps. Looking at this team it should be good, but with a combination of injuries and Steffon Diggs,
                Jason finds himself with a mediocre point total yet somehow still a playoff record. In week one if I had
                to give his team a color it would probably be blue, but going into his week 9 matchup against Coah
                Glatz, his running back core feels red hot! Look out for Jason’s matchups with the Clancy’s, they’d love
                to add another Drexel to their collection.

                Drunk Taylor Swift - --I don’t know about you, but im feeling 3 and 5! Everything will be alright if
                Rodgers stays alive! -- Coach other Clancy is headlining the underachievers in slots 7-9. These teams
                are all tied for the second to last seed, but they’re not out of the playoffs yet. This season is
                treating Erin worse than the reputation era treated the real Taylor Swift. You could say there’s a Blank
                Space where her running backs used to be. This season so far has left Teardrops on her fantasy team.
                We’ll see if she can Shake It Off this week when she goes up against Erin’s brother’s sister’s boyfriend
                Coach Mungillo. Will it be a Love Story, or will there be Bad Blood?

                Barkley reincarnated - Coach Glatz can weld underwater, but he can't seem to weld together a fantasy
                team. My predecessor, and I’m paraphrasing here, stated that “Alex is capable of an upset,” and that’s
                exactly what happened in week 8. I’d say Coach Glatz does seem capable of more upsets but they are
                neither predictable, nor commonplace, and they are still, in fact, upsets. Despite his tarnished 3-5
                record, hope is not lost for this brave Saquon-less soul as he can still find redemption in the form of
                playoffs if he continues to post weeks like this one. You got a W and moved closer to a wild card spot
                and for that you earned spot 8.

                James - Coach James has posted 3-5 record and is tied with Coach Glatz for the second fewest points,
                although I’ll give him somewhat of a pass because he forgot to set his lineup against Coach Smith
                (that’s convenient). Still, despite being in a 3-way tie for last place of the teams that matter, James’
                team is to be the most feared. This team has more big names in it than the Greek Men’s Soccer Team. If
                his players decide to start getting their shit together, James will quickly move up the power rankings,
                and league rankings, alike. As it stands, James went big at the draft, but unfortunately he also seems
                to be on his way home.

                Shitbag Titty Fuck — Nice name change, it’s your best managerial decision of the season. I don’t know
                how
                to even describe how awful this week was for you. It’s the worst week we’ve seen in the two years the
                Bool League has existed, by far. You gave ALEX a win. That’s how bad your team is.
